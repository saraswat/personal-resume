His thesis on "Concurrent Constraint Programming" (supervised by Dana Scott) won the 1989 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. Vijay worked for nine years in the Scientific and Engineering Reasoning Area at Xerox PARC (with Johan de Kleer, Danny Bobrow and colleagues), on model-based reasoning and diagnosis, constraints, linear logic,  natural language semantics and networked virtual worlds. He moved to AT&T Research in 1996 where he became Technology Consultant and led the creation of the AT&T Matrix and Instant Messaging systems, and co-chaired various IETF Working Groups on Instant Messaging and Presence. After a couple of startups and a year as a Professor at Penn State, Vijay joined IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Sep 2003. There, he led the work on the X10 programming language, and parallel programming models, including the Main Memory Map Reduce engine M3R and the Global Matrix Library. In 2013, he was named Chief Scientist of ODM Insight for his role in the creation of a new IBM product on Real-time Insight. In 2014, he became Chief Scientist for the Computing as a Service Division of IBM Research. He has published over 100 papers that have been cited over 7500 times. He has taught at several universities world-wide, and is an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University in New York.
