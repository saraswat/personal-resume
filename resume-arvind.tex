\section*{Education}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ph.D, Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, January 1989;
   Title: Concurrent Constraint Programming;
   Advisor: Dana S. Scott.

\item M.S., Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 1985.

\item B.Tech., Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology,

\end{itemize}

\section*{Professional Interests}

I work now at the heart of cognitive computing -- figuring out how to
build autonomous, self-learning bots that can exhibit professional
facility in deep domains. To this work I bring a very broad and
diverse background in theoretical computer science (logic, semantics,
algorithms), programming systems (concurrent, constraint-based
computing, high-performance computing, programming languages) and
artificial intelligence (model-based computing, diagnosis and natural
language processing, and, now, machine learning and probabilistic
logic representations).   

I have worked 25 years in Corporate Research (9 years at Xerox PARC on
AI and constraint programming), 4 years at AT\&T Research on Instant
Messaging and Network Communities, and 12 years at IBM TJ Watson on
X10, scale-out programming and analytics). I have also spent 4 years
at three startups (Carnegie Group Inc, Vayusphere, Kirusa). And, I was a
Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University
for a year.

system} Implementing the \textsf{ jcc} system under the Lesser GPL
licence on SourceForge. The system implements the (default) (timed)
concurrent constraint programming framework in Java, for embedded
and discrete- and continuous-time computing. The implementation is
targeted for model-based programming applications in the NASA domain
(Mars rovers), and in the systems biology domain.

 \item[2001-2002] \textbf{Kirusa Multimodal Platform.}

 As VP Engineering, leading the team that is developing and delivering
 KMMP.  Chief architect for the product, which supports the development
 of multimodal applications (those which simultaneously use voice and
 visual interfaces) for wireless devices. The product is primarily
 based on Java proxy/servlet technology and is designed for 2.5G
 networks (e.g.{} GPRS), and processes the XML-based multimodal markup
 language (M3L), which integrates the WAP Markup Language (WML) and the
 voice markup language (VoiceXML).

 Chief designer of M3L, and author of the language spec.

\item[2000-2001] \textbf{Vayusphere Monsoon Real-time Messaging System}.

Director of the group, designer and chief server-side implementer.
  Monsoon features a scalable, open, extensible architecture for
  Instant Messaging, with two-way interop with email. All server-side
  code was in Java 2; the system also used an Oracle Database, and
  made extensive use of open source components (Apache, Tomcat
  (servlet runner), James (mail engine)). Designed a simple wire
  protocol which is used for all server-to-server and client-to-server
  communication.

  Supervised development of native clients in C and C++ for the RIM
  Mobitex devices, wireless Palm OS devices, and wireless BREW
  devices.  Supervised development in Delphi of a full-featured
  Windows desktop client. Supervised development of HDML/WAP clients
  for phones.

  Assembled the engineering and QA team from scratch, and had the
  product ready for beta in under three months.  Development and QA
  teams were scattered over Mountain Lakes (NJ), Mountain View (Ca),
  San Diego (Ca), Oakland (Ca) and Indiana, and at peak numbered
  approx 20 people.

  Product released to first customer (major national ISP) in nine
  months.

\item[1999-2000] \textbf{AT\&T Instant Intercom.} 

  Founded, staffed and directed the development team that delivered
  AT\&T's instant messaging system into trial with AT\&T Wireless in
  March 2000. I was the main designer and architect, and chief
  server-side implementer. After I left AT\&T, the system was deployed
  by AT\&T Worldnet. In production use today, it has been downloaded
  by over 120,000 users, and supports approx 20,000 simultaneous
  users. It has been designed to scale to a million registered and
  100,000 simultaneous users.

  The system features a modular architecture with several different
  kinds of servers (IM servers, Presence servers, Chat room
  servers). I designed the binary extensible protocol (documented in
  an IETF Draft) used by servers to communicate with each other and
  with clients. Supervised the design of a C++ I/O module to
  circumvent scalability limitations of Java's synchronous I/O
  architecture.

  Supervised development of a native Windows client in Delphi, a Java
  applet client, a black-phone voice client (using PML, a precursor to
  VoiceXML), and of an HDML client (in collaboration with
  AT\&T Wireless).

\item[1997-1998]   \textbf{AT\&T Matrix.}

  Built the first version of the Matrix system in
  Java 1.1.  AT\&T Matrix was a persistent network community server that
  could be extended by programming world objects in Java.  A Matrix
  server is accessed through a Matrix client (developed in Java using
  Swing).  Servers and clients communicate through a completely
  self-contained \textit{session-oriented Remote Method Invocation} (SMI)
  system designed and implemented after analyzing the very poor design
  of the initial Java RMI system.  SMI uses Java's native object
  serialization and class loaders.  World objects provided their own
  graphical user interface, displayed in clients.

  Supervised development of a Java Swing-based client, and the
  development of several world objects (games, bulletin boards, chat
  rooms).  Core team grew to approx. half a dozen people, before
  project was converted into an Instant Messaging project (see below).

  The system was demonstrated to several people in the Labs, was in
  use by the development team, and served as the basis for an internal
  Instant Messaging trial for several hundred people in AT\&T Labs in
  summer 1999.

  The success of this work led to the invitation to form the Network
  Communities Platform Group (NCPG) in AT\&T Labs in November 1998.

\item[1997]\textbf{Meadows.}

 Founded the Meadows online community for parents, school-children and
 teachers across multiple school districts. Responsible for running
 the MOO, and extending it with various objects.

 Taught classes in elementary and middle school (2d grade to 6th
 grade) on Meadows.


\item[1995]\textbf{Pueblo.}

Founded the Pueblo online community (pueblo.xerox.com 7777), using the
 MOO system, with Jim Walters and Billie Hughes of Phoenix College,
 January 1995. As of May 1996, the community had over 1000 characters,
 including over 300 students from Phoenix and New York, and has over
 20,000 objects.

 Responsible for running the MOO, and creating many world objects.

\item[1992-1994]\textbf{Model-based Computing.} 

While at Xerox PARC, initiated and led a project on constraint-based
  machine control.  Implemented the first version of a
  constraint-based real-time scheduler in C++, and supervised a small
  team of engineers at Xerox Engineering in Rochester (New York).
  Code was shipped in the embedded controller for Xerox' digital
  mid-volume reprographics engines.  This work led to several US
  Patents, and an award for Excellence in Research from Xerox PARC.

\item[1992]\textbf{QD-Janus}

Collaborated with Saumya Debray on the QD Janus implementation. See
  ``S.K.~Debray, QD-Janus: A sequential implementation of Janus in
  Prolog, Software Practice and Experience, Volume 23, Number 12,
  December 1993, pp. 1337-1360.''


\item[1986]\textbf{CRL-Prolog, CRL-OPS}

While a scientist at Carnegie Group Inc., designed and implemented
  CRL-Prolog --- a fast Prolog implementation that compiles into
  Common Lisp and is closely integrated with the frame-based language
  CRL.  Supervised the implementation of CRL-Ops.  CRL-Prolog
  and CRL-Ops were shipped as part of the product \textit{Knowledge
  Craft}.
